Tech Exercise:

1.	Aim:
Aim of this task is to Implement a EAD calculator in Python. 

2.	Package Details:

    2.1 Main Program:
                 
        EAD.py is the Main Program which will do EAD Calculation.

    2.2 Unit Test Program:
                       
        unit_testing.py is the unit testing program to test the result of the program with Expected result.
             
    2.3 Input Files:
        
        1.derivatives_data.json is the transactional Data.
        2.Asset_class_addons.json is a Static Data.
        3.Expected_Result.json is the input for unit test program (unit_testing.py) to compare with Actual Result.
               
    2.4 Output File:
        
        Derivative_data_EAD_Output.json output file with EAD value for each derivative data. (Please note that this file will be provided as a part of this package, but to execute and test the program this file is not required. This will be generated when we run EAD.py)

3.	Execution Steps:
     
    Step 1: Place all input files and program files in one folder.
    Step 2: Execute EAD.py
    Step 3: Input Prompt will be displayed on the screen. 
    Step 4: Enter the input file name “derivatives_data.json”
    Step 5: Program will calculate the EAD based on the static file “Asset_class_addons.json” and Generates the Output file “Derivative_data_EAD_Output.json” with EAD value.

4.	Testing:

    Execute the unit_testing.py to Compare the actual EAD value with Excepted value. This Program uses “Expected_Result.json” file for testing with Actual numbers.
